title: "OpenClaw Cron Jobs for Automated Memory Maintenance"
description: "Cron jobs automate the tedious parts of AI memory: nightly reviews, inbox processing, project health checks, and scheduled tasks. Here's how to set them up in OpenClaw."

> **TL;DR:** OpenClaw cron jobs run AI tasks on a schedule — nightly reviews at 23:00, morning briefings at 08:00, health checks hourly. Each cron job gets its own isolated session with full context. Key crons for memory: nightly review (processes the day), morning briefing (prepares the day), and health monitoring (catches failures). Don't over-cron — batch periodic checks into heartbeats instead.

## What OpenClaw Cron Jobs Are

Cron jobs are scheduled tasks that run automatically. In OpenClaw, each cron job spawns an isolated AI session at the scheduled time, executes the task, and delivers results to a specified channel.

```
/cron add "0 23 * * *" "Run the nightly memory review..."
```

This runs every day at 23:00. The AI gets its own session, reads its memory files, does the work, and reports back.

## The Essential Crons for Memory

### 1. Nightly Review (Critical)

```
Schedule: 0 23 * * * (23:00 daily)
```

The most important cron job. Fully covered in [How Nightly Reviews Make Your AI Smarter](/blog/nightly-reviews-make-ai-smarter). It:

- Reviews the day's transcript
- Writes the structured daily note
- Processes inbox → PARA files
- Updates project statuses
- Archives completed work
- Flags items for tomorrow

**Without this, your memory files go stale within days.**

### 2. Morning Briefing (Optional but Valuable)

```
Schedule: 0 8 * * 1-5 (08:00 weekdays)
```

A morning summary delivered to your messaging channel:

- Today's calendar events
- P1/P2 project statuses and next actions
- Anything flagged by last night's review
- Weather if relevant

This replaces the "what are we working on today?" conversation. You get a structured briefing before your first coffee.

### 3. Health Monitor (Recommended)

```
Schedule: 0 */4 * * * (every 4 hours)
```

Checks that other cron jobs are running correctly:

- Did the nightly review run last night?
- Are there consecutive errors on any job?
- Is the gateway responsive?

Alerts you only if something is broken. Silent otherwise.

## Cron vs Heartbeat: When to Use Which

This is the most common point of confusion:

| Use Cron | Use [Heartbeat](/blog/openclaw-heartbeat-system) |
|---|---|
| Exact timing required | Timing can drift |
| Isolated session needed | Main session context useful |
| Different model/thinking level | Same model as main session |
| One-shot tasks | Recurring multi-check routines |
| "At 9am every Monday" | "Every 30-60 minutes, check stuff" |

**Common mistake:** Creating 5 cron jobs for things that could be one heartbeat check. Email checking, Twitter monitoring, project health — these should all be batched into [heartbeats](/blog/openclaw-heartbeat-system), not separate crons.

**Use cron for:** Nightly review, morning briefing, weekly reports, scheduled reminders, tasks that need isolation or exact timing.

## Setting Up Crons in OpenClaw

### Basic Syntax

```
/cron add "<schedule>" "<task description>"
```

The schedule uses standard cron syntax:

| Field | Values | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Minute | 0-59 | 30 = at minute 30 |
| Hour | 0-23 | 8 = 8:00 AM |
| Day of Month | 1-31 | 15 = 15th |
| Month | 1-12 | * = every month |
| Day of Week | 0-7 (0,7=Sun) | 1-5 = weekdays |

### Common Schedules

| Schedule | Cron Expression |
|---|---|
| Every day at 23:00 | `0 23 * * *` |
| Weekdays at 08:00 | `0 8 * * 1-5` |
| Every 4 hours | `0 */4 * * *` |
| Every Monday at 09:00 | `0 9 * * 1` |
| First of month at 10:00 | `0 10 1 * *` |

### Managing Crons

```
/cron list          — show all scheduled jobs
/cron delete <id>   — remove a job
/cron pause <id>    — temporarily disable
/cron resume <id>   — re-enable
```

## Task Description Best Practices

The task description is what the AI actually does. Write it like you're briefing a colleague:

**❌ Too vague:**
```
"Do the nightly review"
```

**✅ Specific and structured:**
```
"Nightly review: 1) Read today's session transcript.
2) Write structured daily note in memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md
   with sections: Summary, Decisions Made, Tasks Completed,
   Open Items, Lessons Learned.
3) Process memory/inbox.md — route each item to the correct
   PARA file.
4) Update project statuses in PROJECTS.md.
5) Move completed projects to ARCHIVE.md.
6) Flag anything needing David's attention."
```

Numbered steps give the AI a clear execution path. Each step is independently verifiable.

## Error Handling

OpenClaw tracks consecutive errors per cron job. Use the [heartbeat health check](/blog/openclaw-heartbeat-system) to monitor:

```markdown
## Heartbeat: Cron Health Check
- List all cron jobs
- Flag any with consecutiveErrors > 0
- If errors found: alert David with job name + error
- If all healthy: log silently
```

Common failure causes:

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Session timeout | Task too complex | Break into smaller steps |
| File not found | Wrong path in task | Check file paths exist |
| API error | Rate limit or auth issue | Check credentials, add retry logic |
| Stale context | Memory files corrupted | Manual review and fix |

## Advanced Patterns

### Weekly Summary Report

```
Schedule: 0 9 * * 1 (Monday 9:00 AM)

Task: Weekly summary: Read daily notes from the past 7 days
(memory/daily/). Produce a weekly report covering: projects
progressed, decisions made, metrics changes, lessons learned,
and priorities for this week. Deliver to Telegram.
```

### Scheduled Content Publishing

```
Schedule: 0 10 * * * (daily 10:00 AM)

Task: Check products/twitter/scheduled-tweets.json for any
tweet scheduled for today. If found, post it via the posting
script. Update the file to mark it as posted.
```

### Monthly Archive Cleanup

```
Schedule: 0 10 1 * * (1st of month, 10:00 AM)

Task: Review memory/ARCHIVE.md. For items older than 3 months,
move them to memory/archive-history.md. Keep ARCHIVE.md under
100 lines for readability.
```

## The Memory Maintenance Stack

All the pieces together:

```
Daily Rhythm:
├── 08:00  Morning briefing (cron)
├── 08:30  First heartbeat — email, calendar, Twitter
├── 09:00  ... heartbeats every 30 min through the day ...
├── 23:00  Nightly review (cron)
└── 23:01  Quiet hours until 08:00

Weekly:
├── Monday 09:00  Weekly summary report (cron)
└── Ongoing  Heartbeat health monitoring

Monthly:
└── 1st 10:00  Archive cleanup (cron)
```

Three cron jobs and one [heartbeat configuration](/blog/openclaw-heartbeat-system). That's the entire automation layer for a self-maintaining AI memory system.

## FAQ

### How many cron jobs should I have?

Start with one: the nightly review. Add more only when you have a clear need. Most people over-cron and end up with expensive jobs that overlap with [heartbeat checks](/blog/openclaw-heartbeat-system). Three to five cron jobs is typical for a well-tuned setup.

### Do cron jobs use the same AI model as my main session?

By default, yes. But OpenClaw lets you specify a different model per cron job. Use a smaller/cheaper model for routine tasks (health checks, simple monitoring) and your primary model for complex tasks (nightly review, content generation).

### What timezone do cron schedules use?

Your system's configured timezone. In OpenClaw, this is typically set in your configuration. Make sure it matches your actual timezone to avoid 3am "morning briefings."

### Can cron jobs interact with each other?

Not directly — each runs in its own isolated session. But they can communicate through files. The nightly review writes a daily note that the morning briefing reads. The health monitor checks cron error counts that other jobs update. Files are the shared state layer.

### What's the minimum interval for cron jobs?

OpenClaw supports minute-level scheduling, but running cron jobs more frequently than every 15 minutes is usually wasteful. For high-frequency checks (every few minutes), use the [heartbeat system](/blog/openclaw-heartbeat-system) instead — it's designed for periodic monitoring.
